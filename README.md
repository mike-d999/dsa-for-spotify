# Duplicate Song Analyzer for Spotify

Spotify does a good job on its own of notifying you when you're about to add a song that already matches one in your playlist.

However... when it comes to playlist enthusiasts like myself that sometimes add hundreds or even thousands of songs to a single playlist, we sometimes end up inadvertently adding identical songs. Either we're quickly adding songs to a playlist and Spotify decides not to notify us that we're adding a duplicate song to one of our playlists, or we just straight up forgot the song was already there. By the time you realize that you may have duplicates in your playlist, you're a thousand songs deep, and it's a very tedious and lengthy process to go back through *all* of your songs one by one and make sure you don't have duplicates of each one - it can take hours to fix your mistake, depending on how many songs you've added.

This is where my program, "Duplicate Song Analyzer for Spotify" comes in.
