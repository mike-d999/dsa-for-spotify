# Duplicate Song Analyzer for Spotify

Spotify does a good job on its own of notifying you when you're about to add a song that already matches one in your playlist... as long as it's an exact match. 

However... when it comes to playlist enthusiasts like myself that sometimes add hundreds or even thousands of songs to a single playlist, we sometimes end up inadvertently adding songs that are identical from multiple albums/EPs/singles. Spotify doesn't catch these duplicate tracks because they are treated as completely different songs... and technically, according to Spotify's database, they are. By the time you realize that you may have duplicates in your playlist, you're a thousand songs deep into your playlist, and it's a very tedious and lengthy process to go back through *all* of your songs one by one and make sure you don't have duplicates of each one - it can take hours to fix your mistake, depending on how many songs you've added.

This is where my program, "Duplicate Song Analyzer for Spotify" comes in.
